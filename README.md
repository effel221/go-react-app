# Simple Go/React app

This is mine (Tatsiana Vladimirovna Salikayeva) take on creating simple full-stack Go/React/Typescript application.

Documentation for <strong>server</strong> Go part located in server folder in README.md<br/>
Documentation for <strong>Frontend</strong> React/Typescript part located in server folder in README.md

This solution took me a little longer, then I expected, because I decided, if typescript not allowed as server part, to try Go for those reasons ans some time for me took to learn some Go bases, which I enjoyed. For Frontend part I decided use kit with React/Typescript/Vite and add vitest and React testing library for testing. Before I used jest a lot, but seeing, that vitest gets more popular, decided to try. It was ok, but also took some time to integrate it with typescript. As always, most time took setting up working enviroment. I would add for future sass, I prefere it, I can set it up, but for just one page decided to be ok with just Css. The task itself was pretty simple, but some thoughts, how better locate, styles, combile  and separate, where done and implemented. I did structure in siplest way but with possibility to grow and extend with more files and folders. I want to mention, that React in strict mode renders componets twice in dev mode, this is not a bug but React feature (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48846289/why-is-my-react-component-is-rendering-twice), so some useEffects in dev mode could be rendered twice. Thank You for this opportunity, I enjoyed every minute of it.
